Whether you were born here or come from abroad you will find that your choices and your background play a significant role once you arrive in Brost County, though where you go from there is entirely up to you.  Whatever the case, the Lands of Intrigue will live up to their name.\n\nTethyr itself is in a state of high tension, poised on the brink of potential political turmoil.  Queen Anais Rhindaun lacks an heir to her throne, and there are those in the shadows that seek to take advantage of this, once more plotting stage a coup and position her niece as Queen instead.  In the Duchy of Noromath, where your journey begins, things are no less dire.  Duke Allain \"Foxfire\" Kevanarial, aloof and absent from much of his political duties over the years, has been killed.  By who or what is unknown, but what is known is that despite the wayward Elven Lord's historic absence from politics, his murder has still left a power vaccuum that is yet to be filled.\n\nTo compound it all, conflict with Amn seems all but certain due to recent troubles along the trade way with Amnian merchant caravans being attacked by unknown assailants.\n\nWhoever you once were or whatever you strive to be, one thing is for sure - the Lands of Intrigue are ripe with equal measure of danger and adventure.\n\nFor information about the setting, server rules, and to meet fellow players, please join our Discord: https://discord.gg/ZRgsBj48uC"

If the adage \"Follow the money, and ye shall find answers to many mysteries\" were true, every investigator and adventurer would end up in Amn, since money flows there as to no other county. Nearly every merchant does business with Amn or passes through it during the course of a year's business deals. Amn's location benefits its mercantile nature, as it is the springboard for Calishite and Tethyrian products heading north to the Heartlands. The country's rich natural resources and its peoples' knack for business soon led Amn to seize its premier status as one of the most important centers of trade in the Realms. Amn is as important as Sembia and Waterdeep even in their own respective geographic markets, and all three countries have long-established rivalries. Amn's future is uncertain at best, with bright and dark strains. \n\nIts merchants and priests have discovered a new country to the west, Maztica, which Amn is colonizing and expoilting-producing trouble at home and abroad. \n\nAmn's neighbor to the south, Tethyr, has finally stabilized into a rich, promising trading partner. However, some Amnian cities are on the verge of rebellion, aiming to join Tethyr.  With the uncertain state of Tethyr's Royal Line of succession such rumors could either be tantalizing or a death trap depending on the one involved.\n\nRumors of monstrous armies are often heard of late. As always, power groups inside Amn and elsewhere vie for supremacy, so much that outsiders view Amn as a stew pot of conspiracy and chaos. For the natives, however, it matters little who is in power so long as business continues to run uninterrupted."

Calimshan embraces a world of contrasts, as its rich are affluent beyond measure just as its poor are destitute beyond belief. It is another world whose inhabitants embrace magic and education but jealously guard them from those they deem unworthy. While confusing to outsiders, Calimshan and its people accept these seemingly contradictory values as life, and it is the outsider's place to learn how to adapt to the Land of the Pashas rather than the alternative."

When one speaks of Tethyr, anyone born in this century thinks only of a land rife with political intrigue, civil unrest, prejudice against demihumans, and assassination. What was one of the noblest of human countries reduced itself to a lawless land. The two decades of the Alemandrian Interregnum increased the ranks of robber barons, criminals, monsters, and religious zealots in the area, further destabilizing it. Though the ascent of Queen Monarch Zaranda Star years ago saw an end to much of this strife, the current days of Tethyr seem poised to topple once more into uncertainty.\n\nThe year is 1494.  26 years ago Anais Rhindaun ascended the throne of Tethyr and her early reign was plagued with internal strife and external tragedy.  Though she eventually secured her rule, the political state of Tethyr is poised on the edge of a Knife.  Lacking a direct heir and fostering the daughter of her traitorous sister, there are those both within and without the Royal Court that seek to take advantage of the tumultous climate and sieze power for themselves."
