Hearing this, the Painbearer suggested the use of a simple herb often recommended for treating heat-illness: humble garlic. By treating bandages with this essential substance, one could accelerate the normal course of recovery from injury. Most consider it a staple tale of Ilmater's priests easing suffering for any and all.\n\nCreating Bandages:\nAdd a Hand of Garlic and Rags items into your Crafter's Box, and use the Combiner on the Crafting Box. Your check will be modified by your healing skill and relevant backgrounds or proficiencies. Each attempt will cost 2 gold.\n\nUse: Bandages can only be used on unarmored creatures who are not in combat.\n"
